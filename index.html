						Hi. I'm Caitlin McQueen, a music fanatic living in Fort Collins, CO. This is my personal music journal documenting the shows I've booked. Many are collaborations with people I deeply respect. Eventually, I hope to add the shows I've attended to this page as well. When I consider just how music has impacted who I am today I think David Byrne sums it up best.&nbsp;

						"I've been involved in music all of my adult life. I didn't plan it that way, and it wasn't even a serious ambition at first, but that's the way it turned out. A very happy accident if you ask me. It's a little strange, though, to realize that a large part of my identity is tied to something that is completely ephemeral. You can't touch music - it exists only at the moment it is being apprehended - and yet it can profoundly alter how we view the world and our place in it. Music can get us through difficult patches in our lives by changing not only how we feel about ourselves, but also how we feel about everything outside ourselves. It's powerful stuff."<a href="http://davidbyrne.com/">David Byrne</a> - How Music Works
