						Hi. I'm Caitlin McQueen, a music fa living in Fort Collins, CO. This is my music journal documenting the shows I've booked. Some are collaborations with people I deeply respect. Others are true community efforts that I was fortunate to land in our small room. Eventually I hope to add the shows I've attended to this page. I've attempted to describe just how much music means to me but I think David Byrne says it best.

					<p class="editable">"I've been involved in music all of my adult life. I didn't plan it that way, and it wasn't even a serious ambition at first, but that's the way it turned out. A very happy accident if you ask me. It's a little strange, though, to realize that a large part of my identity is tied to something that is completely ephemeral. You can't touch music - it exists only at the moment it is being apprehended - and yet it can profoundly alter how we view the world and our place in it. Music can get us through difficult patches in our lives by changing not only how we feel about ourselves, but also how we feel about everything outside ourselves. It's powerful stuff." - How Music Works</p>
